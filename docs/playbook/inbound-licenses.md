## Understanding Open Source Software Licenses

Although it is widely assumed that all open source software can be used "for free", in reality, there are often conditions attached to use, and it becomes important to understand these conditions.  For example:

- Can I use the software for commercial purposes?
- Do I have to advertise the fact that I am using a particular piece of software?
- Am I allowed to make changes to the software?
- If I make changes, do I have to publish them back to the original authors?

In brief, there is a wide spectrum of different types of software license, each with different restrictions and provisions.  If you are consuming open source software within your organisation, then it is important the types of license used are tracked to prevent legal complications.

### Transitive Dependencies

Often, one piece of open source software will be built from other open source components.  These are known as dependencies.  _Transitive dependencies_ refers to this hierarchy of dependencies.  A developer using a piece of open source software with one license might accidentally pick up (via dependency) other pieces of software _transitively_ with different licenses.

### Variations 

A second problem with tracking licenses is that there are _a great many of them_.   Here are a couple of resources which list the most commonly used licenses:

 - [FINOS Page on License Categories](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/license-categories)  
 - [Open Source Initiative's Page on License Categories](https://opensource.org/licenses/category)

The problem is further compounded by the fact that often the terms of the licenses get changed
