_Effort Estimation_ is the process of trying to predict how much effort (expressed in terms of person-hours or money) a given activity will take.   

-- RM:  Jim, I'm not sure how useful this article is going to be.   Software estimation is a huge, complex topic that it might be best not to get into!



Software development metrics have existed in various forms since the 1980s and 1990s, and were considered extremely important before the advent of object oriented programming and low-code/no-code. However, software metrics has continued to evolve as a discipline.



Most recently, The International Cost Estimating and Analysis Association (https://www.iceaaonline.com/) have developed a cost estimating body of knowledge (BOK) that can be a guide for OSS metrics and understanding business value. 
The BOK provides Three Ways to Create a  Software (Development) Estimate:

Way | Process | Associated   approach | Pre-requisites   for Selecting
-- | -- | -- | --
1st | - Estimate size  - Estimate effort based on size (with productivity implied)  - Estimate schedule and cost based on effort | 1. Parametric   (Derive   CER)   2. Parametric   (Published   CER) | • Historical   data   • Software   size estimate available   • Known   criteria
2nd | ·           Estimate size, productivity      ·           Estimate effort based on size and   productivity      ·           Estimate schedule and cost based on   effort | 3. Analogy   (Productivity-based) | Analogy   available   • Software   size estimate available   • Known   criteria
• 3rd | ·           Estimate effort, schedule and cost   based on expert opinion | 4. Wideband   Delphi   Expert   Opinion | • Lack   of historical data   • May   not know software size
Cross-check1 | ·           Use additional approaches (above) or   published Rules-of-Thumb      ·           Used to support primary approach | 5. Commercial   Estimating   Models   6. Rules   of thumb | Known   criteria (see Lesson Z)   • Rough   order of magnitude
