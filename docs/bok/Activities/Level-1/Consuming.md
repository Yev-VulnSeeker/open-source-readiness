## Open Source vs Proprietary (Commercial) Software

- Case for open source vs. commercial. 
   - Is support that important?  
   - Is it better to have a large _ecosystem_ rather than support (e.g. Java, Python, fungibility of developers/experts)
   - Commercial software license change (e.g. https://www.supportrevolution.com/oracle-support-price-rises/)
   
## Understanding Repositories, Namespaces, Versions




Approved to leverage open source and pulling in dependency in their projects.


## Infrastructure

 - Firewalls, getting access to open source.
 - Getting access to GitHub.
 - Explanation for why this is often blocked.

## Choosing Healthy Dependencies

Choosing [healthy open source dependencies](../Measurements/Project-Health)
Risks of choosing defunct libraries.

## Choosing Languages

Things to look for in language choice.  (link to existing articles)


## Ways Of Using Open Source 

(from the mind map)

- standalone tool
- snippets or files (from GitHub say)
- libraries and packages
- forking

## Suggested Steps

Have own profile and develop in personal repos.
