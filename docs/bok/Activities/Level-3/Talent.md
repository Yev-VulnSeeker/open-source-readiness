 - Finance organisations are great at _attracting_ talent by simply paying very high wages.  The problem is attrition.  
 - It's important to understand that lots of open source is developed for _non-financial rewards_.   
 - If you hire a key engineer who is a top contributor to an open source project then you are preventing them from contributing anymore.  They will leave.
 - Even if you allow them to continue contributing, but the workflow is onerous (e.g. MD-level reviews of their code) they will also get fed up and leave.
 - To _retain_ these high-performing staff, you have to give them the right tools to carry on contributing effectively.
 - GitHub is _becoming a CV_.
 
 
2.  Talent Retention

 - Finance organisations are great at _attracting_ talent by simply paying very high wages.  The problem is attrition.  
 - It's important to understand that lots of open source is developed for _non-financial rewards_.   
 - If you hire a key engineer who is a top contributor to an open source project and then prevent them from contributing further then they will likely leave.
 - Even if you allow them to continue contributing, if the workflow is onerous (e.g. MD-level reviews of their code) they will also get fed up and leave.
 - To _retain_ these high-performing staff, you have to give them the right tools to carry on contributing effectively.
 - Also: GitHub is _becoming a CV_.
 - Ironically, hiring from a strategic open source project actually will reduce the value of that project if the employee isn't allowed to contribute back.
