## License Compliance

 - What consitutes an acceptable license depends on the software, the license and the context it is used in.  
 - For this reason, it is difficult to get (say the legal department) to review each license and make a blanket decision on each one.
 - Again - look to tooling to help mitigate this risk.  Can software project's build be failed because the wrong licenses are included in the codebase?
 - See [License Compliance Management](../Activities/Level-2/License-Management.md)

## Cross-Border Obligations

 - Many organisations are bound by what is allowed to cross their borders.  For example:  in Swiss banks, there are strong controls in place to make sure no data leaves Switzerland.  
 - This is a consideration for code too, as code _contributed to GitHub_ is data leaving the organisation and there may be requirements around these obligations.
 - Another example of why preventing contributions with "test data" in them may be good policy.

## Export Regulations

 - In a similar vein, many countries are prevented from selling into certain territories.  US/Iran for example.
 - There are rules in the US about exporting "non-standard crypto" (which might include obfuscated code).
 - Is open source contribution encompassed in "selling"?
