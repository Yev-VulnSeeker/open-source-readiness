Wikipedia defines Return on Investment (ROI) as: 

> Return on investment (ROI) or return on costs (ROC) is a ratio between net income (over a period) and investment (costs resulting from an investment of some resources at a point in time). A high ROI means the investment's gains compare favourably to its cost. - [Return on Investment, _Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment)

ROI is usually considered for a given _activity_ and is expressed as a ratio or percentage.  _Ceteris paribus_, an activity with 15% ROI will be more useful than one with a 5% ROI.  However, ROI doesn't have a time component:  if two activities take different amounts of time, then they can't be compared directly with ROI and tools like [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value) or [Payback Period/Break-even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payback_period) might be more appropriate.

## Applying ROI to Software

The [Demonstrating Value Initiative](https://www.demonstratingvalue.org/) established a [workbook](https://www.demonstratingvalue.org/sites/default/files/resource-files/Calculate%20Return%20on%20Investment%20for%20Software.xlsx) to use a guide to understanding software ROI. 

This workbook is designed to calculate a return on investment (ROI) for new software like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management system). Doing this can help you understand if a proposed purchase is worthwhile, and can help you make a case for investment to others.  

The calculator includes an example, which shows you a complete calculation. The user inputs basic assumptions as well as data about costs and savings, both upfront and into the future.  It includes cost calculations for staff time involved in implementation and training.

##Â Applying ROI To Open Source

Explain how ROI calculations differ for open source software, maybe in a table.  e.g.

 - up-front purchase costs are zero.  
 - support costs 
 - maintentance costs brought in-house
 
Perhaps compare with SaaS as this is a common way of delivering software now.
