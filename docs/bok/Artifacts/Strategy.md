# Creating an Open Source Strategy

The majority of companies that use open source understand its business value and identify its advantages in efficiency, flexibility, interoperability, and speed of innovation. Yet only half of these companies report practicing basic open source management, such as community development, code maintenance, and the like, according to the latest Linux Foundation Future of Open Source survey.

Creating and documenting an open source strategy is an essential first step to realizing Return on Investment (ROI) with open source. Your open source strategy connects the plans for managing, participating in, and creating open source software with the business objectives that the plans serve. This can open up many opportunities and catalyze innovation.
